## Use case
We want to know the DSDT and SSDT tables from our users so we can create an
application that automatically detects the right ACPI calls. Machine
information from `dmidecode` must be attached too so we know from which
manufacturer and model the tables are from.

## Current practices
These tables are available from the dump from the `acpidump` tool. Then,
`acpixtract` extracts the SSDT and DSDT tables from the previous dump which can
be converted to human-readable ASL using `iasl`.
Until now, the user would have to:

1. install `acpidump` and `iasl`
2. Run `acpidump`, `acpixtract` and `iasl` to generate the human-readable ASL
   files (*.dsl)
3. Run `dmidecode` several times for the manufacturer and model info
4. Create a tarball of the generated files (*.dsl and dmidecode.txt)
5. Send the result to an emailaddress or mailing list

## Comments
Currently, the submission of the dsl files are scattered and the information
often incomplete (missing machine information). Known places to find the ASL
files are the mailing list of Launchpad Hybrid Graphics, the ACPI wiki page of
Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee and mailboxes of several developers. This makes it
hard to get to the actual task: analysing the files.
Furthermore, the current commands may be too complicated for the user, which
may lead to errors in running the right command.

## Goal
The commands for the user should be as easy as possible and the submission less
difficult, meaning that sending a mail may be too difficult since it involves
opening the mail client, selecting the tarball as attachment and press "Send".
For developers and other interested people, the next features should be
available:

- Search by machine information
- Download each individual DSDT or SSDT table
- Get a listing of submissions for each manufacturer, subdivided by product
  names
- Search through the headers of the ASL files (OEM ID, OEM Table ID)
